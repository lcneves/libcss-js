// 3. pre-run appended it, var Module = {}; ..generated code..

// case, where this code here is minified but Module was defined
// elsewhere (e.g. case 4 above). We also need to check if Module
// already exists (e.g. case 3 above).
// Note that if you want to run closure, and also to use Module

// before the code. Then that object will be used in the code, and you
